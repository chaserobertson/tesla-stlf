# Short-Term Load Forecasting for TESLA Asia Pacific

## Data Sources
Data is currently stored in the `data` directory, but can also be pulled from the original source, [Australia Energy Market Operator](https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem).

Various aggregations and merges have been conducted on the source data and saved - this may call for some way of distinguising between source and modified data files. Todo.

## Actions
Next steps are to replicate the model specified in McCulloch and Ignatieva's "Intra-day Electricity Demand and Temperature".

## Literature Cited
- McCulloch and Ignatieva: "Intra-day Electricity Demand and Temperature"

Perhaps useful for building on the base model in the future:
